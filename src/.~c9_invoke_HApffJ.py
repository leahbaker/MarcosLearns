# ======================== 
# NEW CODE BASED ON COMMENTS
# Ignore everything else. We are finding out what the heck this string is and where it comes from and what to do with it. Thats it! 
# Do these IN ORDER and do not move on until the previous one is working. They build on each other. 
# ========================

#### TODO #1: Where are those "None" values coming from? Use lots of words! I know you know it!

# ========================

#TODO #2: Rewrite the function so that it shows you the string value but only prints one thing every time you run it, no more none. 

leahString1 = "LEAH"
leahString2 = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Ut mi orci, facilisis scelerisque urna et, imperdiet elementum massa."
leahString3 = "* Im a Su Per WeirD ! $ St>ing :)"

def validate_string(str):
    pass

print(validate_string(leahString1))
print(validate_string(leahString2))
print(validate_string(leahString3))
