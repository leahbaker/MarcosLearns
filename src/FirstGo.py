# ======================== 
# NEW CODE BASED ON COMMENTS
# Ignore everything else. We are finding out what the heck this string is and where it comes from and what to do with it. Thats it! 
# Do these IN ORDER and do not move on until the previous one is working. They build on each other. 
# ========================

#TODO #1: Im going to give you three strings. Use validate to just print out the value of those strings.

leahString1 = "LEAH"
leahString2 = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Ut mi orci, facilisis scelerisque urna et, imperdiet elementum massa."
leahString3 = "* Im a Su Per WeirD ! $ St>ing :)"

def validate_string(str):
    pass #print the string

#call function 3 times, once with each string. check out the strings printed! 


# ========================

#TODO #2: This is going to print true or false based on whether or not the string is "true" or not.

leahString1 = "true"
leahString2 = "false"
leahString3 = "True"

def validate_string2(str):
    pass #return true if string is "true" and false otherwise

validate_string2(leahString1) #should print true! 
validate_string2(leahString2) #should print false
validate_string2(leahString3) #should print false


# ========================

#TODO #3: Think of 4 more things that might be true of a string that would fail to make ASCII art or make it icky

#WHY I SUCK FOR ASCII ART: 
badString1 = "T H I S H A S S P A C E S E V E R Y W H E R E"

#WHY I SUCK FOR ASCII ART: 
badString2 = "TODO"

#WHY I SUCK FOR ASCII ART: 
badString3 = "TODO"

#WHY I SUCK FOR ASCII ART: 
badString4 = "TODO"

#WHY I SUCK FOR ASCII ART: 
badString5 = "TODO"


# ========================

#TODO #4: Given the information that the user will be typing in a string to use to make art, why might we want to "validate it" before trying to turn it into art?
